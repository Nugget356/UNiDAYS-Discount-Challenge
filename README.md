# UNiDAYS-Discount-Challenge
My code for the UNiDAYS placement challenge.

To run the executable program go to UNiDAYS-Placement\UNiDAYS-Placement\Debug\UNiDAYS-Placement.exe

To view the code and edit what items to be added open UNiDAYS-Placement\UNiDAYS-Placement.sln
This will open up the main c++ file and also the class (UnidaysDiscountChallenge) C++ and .h file to be viewed.
